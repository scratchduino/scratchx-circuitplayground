# scratchx-circuitplayground

Scratchduino is a project developed to help young people easily integrate physical elements in their digital creations and expand their computers’ ability to interact with the physical world, using affordable hardware.

Using Scratchduino kids can build interactive stories, animations and games that have physical elements including sensors, buttons and motors. It’s build upon the Scratch platform (as a ScratchX extension) and currently works with the Circuit Playground - a relatively cheap an all-in-one board from Adafruit that has sensors and LEDs built in.

The Scratchduino project is based on work done by embeditelectronics.
